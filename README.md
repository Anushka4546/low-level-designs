## 📅 What is this?

This repository is my commitment to solving one Low-Level Design (LLD) problem every day.  
Each entry includes:  
- Problem statement & requirements  
- Design approach and key decisions  
- Diagrams (UML/class, where relevant)  
- Clean, well-documented code  
- Reflections & notes
